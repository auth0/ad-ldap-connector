  "readme": "# Cookie-Sessions\n\nSecure cookie-based session middleware for\n[Connect](http://github.com/senchalabs/connect). This is a new module and I\nwouldn't recommend for production use just yet.\n\nSession data is stored on the request object in the 'session' property:\n\n    var connect = require('connect'),\n        sessions = require('cookie-sessions');\n\n    Connect.createServer(\n        sessions({secret: '123abc'}),\n        function(req, res, next){\n            req.session = {'hello':'world'};\n            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type':'text/plain'});\n            res.end('session data updated');\n        }\n    ).listen(8080);\n\nThe session data is JSON.stringified, encrypted and timestamped, then a HMAC\nsignature is attached to test for tampering. The main function accepts a\nnumber of options:\n\n    * secret -- The secret to encrypt the session data with\n    * timeout -- The amount of time in miliseconds before the cookie expires\n      (default: 24 hours)\n    * session_key -- The cookie key name to store the session data in\n      (default: _node)\n    * path -- The path to use for the cookie (default: '/')\n\t* domain -- (optional) Define a specific domain/subdomain scope for the cookie\n\n\n## Why store session data in cookies?\n\n* Its fast, you don't need to hit the filesystem or a database to look up\n  session data\n* It scales easily. You don't need to worry about sticky-sessions when\n  load-balancing across multiple nodes.\n* No server-side persistence requirements\n\n## Caveats\n\n* You can only store 4k of data in a cookie\n* Higher-bandwidth requirements, since the cookie is sent to the server with\n  every request.\n\n__In summary:__ don't use cookie storage if you keep a lot of data in your\nsessions!\n",
